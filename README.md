# molecular_solubility_predictor
A Jupyter notebook that shows the application of Linear Regression to predict aqueous solubility of chemical compounds. The Python library rdkit is used to handle/manipulate properties of chemical compounds and a linear regression model was created using scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library.
